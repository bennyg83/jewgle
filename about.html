    I was sitting with some friends having a Sukkot lunch when one of them
    looked at me and said, "Wouldn't it be great if we had a single website
    which hosted all shiurim so we could search all the different ideas and
    Rabbis in one place?"<br/>
    I thought it was a great idea, but took it a bit further.  When I look for
    Jewish material, I find that google will provide me with both Jewish,
    Orthodox, non-religious and Christian sources all at the same time.<br/>
    I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be great to just be able to Jewgle something?"</p></bold>
